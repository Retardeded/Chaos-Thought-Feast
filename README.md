Main gameplay is, you set your starting wiki article. By default it's this article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz

You also choose your goal title, that you want to find through some "concept association", by clicking the wiki link that is more closely related to the goal title than your current one.
By default the end title is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe

The English version is currently more robust than the Polish bcs the database is english.
Generally I still need to remove quite a lot unpopular articles, so game is as playable as possible.
The end goal is to create bunch of categories so that you can choose category you feel the most familiar with and then from that category,
only the most popular articles will be randomly selected so that the game should be very much playable for as many people as possible.

There is some strange bug, so that app does not even launch, if you want to launch it second time, didn't dive deep into it, but you can always reinstall.
