# WikiSearchGame

You need to build this app with Andriod Studio.

Then you set your starting wiki article. By default it's this article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz

You also choose the title you want to find through some "concept association", by clicking the wiki link that is more closely related to the goal title than your current one.

By default the end title is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe

It is definitely possible to find it with less than 10 steps, starting from the quiz title. So you may as well just press Start and test your skill/luck.
