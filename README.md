# WikiSearchGame

You need to build this app with Andriod Studio.

Then you set your starting wiki article. By default it's this article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz

You also choose the title you want to find through some "concept association", by clicking the wiki link that is more closely related to the goal title than your current one.

By default the end title is this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe

It is definitely possible to find it with less than 10 steps, starting from the quiz title. So you may as well just press Start and test your skill/luck.

You need to register first on ENG version kinda works, generally i need to focus on refining the data, so that it is as playable as possible.
The end goal is to create bunch of categories so that you can choose category you feel the most familiar with and then from that category only
like the most popular articles will be randomly selected so that the game should be very much playable for as much people as possible.
